     	<h1>The Embarissing Moment</h1>

        <p>I don't want to hide things that make me look bad. I thought I would only drink with my friends. 
        Coz they always take care of me. But after 6 months, my roommate asked for a company and I still regret the decision 
        of saying yes. I drunk, I fucked up, I drunk call my ex and that is a mastake and the biggest is I drunk called her sister too.
        We again ended up having a fight for nth time. </p>

        <p>The thing I'm an introvert man I don't know how to start a conversation to share what I feel. I always end up making bad impression
        I wanted to be tough, but deep inside I feel like I need someone to share to fight to cuddle and most importantly to call someone as my own.</p>

     	<p>So, Every time when I make a big mistake I go to this girl and say all the stupid things I did, It makes me feel better. Now, I want to hide this from her. </p>
     	
        <p>See these kind of things happen so rare. Everybody who travelled with me know how insanely kind and good I'm. So my regret is momentary.


        I wanted to tag my crush in instagram memes, but I'm unable to make a dare. People who reading this give me some damn good ideas I just wanted to tag her in every crush meme. </p>
        <p>Yes! i'm feeling good now. </p>

        <p>Here is my new fav song.</p>
